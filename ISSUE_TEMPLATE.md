# ADD FEED
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I want to add my feed to the Python Planet.

**My Name/Blog Name**: MY_NAME_OR_BLOG_NAME_HERE (e.g John Doe Awesome Blog)  

**My Blog RSS or ATOM Python specific feed url**: MY_FEED_URL  
 
## I checked the following required validations: (mark all 4 with [x])

1. [ ] My feed is valid, I checked using https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=MY_FEED_URL and it is valid!
2. [ ] My feed is a **Python Specific** feed, e.g: I am informing the filtered tag or categorized feed url
3. [ ] I commit to post only content related to Python language and its components and libraries. Or content that I consider interesting for the Python community.
4. [ ] I am aware that since my feed is added it can take a few hours to start being fetched (on server update cycle)

Thanks in advance for adding my feed to the PythonPlanet! :+1:
